1/6 Countdown to Blast Off's Layer-1 mainnet is nearing completion, with the Token Generation Event (TGE) imminent. Supra's L1 network utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, leveraging Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for efficient and secure validation.

2/6 The Supra L1 network employs a DPoS consensus mechanism, where validators are chosen through a voting process, and token holders delegate their tokens to these validators to participate in the validation process.

3/6 Supra's Token Claim Plans are designed to allow players to claim their tokens at a specific time, with two plans available: Accelerated Unlock and Slow Vesting. The Accelerated Unlock plan allows for faster token access, while the Slow Vesting plan locks up tokens for a longer duration.

4/6 The Supra L1 network utilizes a hybrid consensus algorithm, combining elements of DPoS and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT). This hybrid approach enhances the network's security and scalability.

5/6 The Supra ecosystem is designed to support a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming, and social media platforms. The network's modular architecture enables seamless integration with various applications.

6/6 Supra's Token Generation Event (TGE) is poised to break world records for Layer-1 users, token holders, and delegates. The network's innovative approach to tokenomics and delegation plans has garnered significant attention from the cryptocurrency community, highlighting the potential for Supra to become a leading player in the DeFi space.
